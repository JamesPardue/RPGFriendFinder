                    I was lurking on some RPG Forum and read a story about a guy who had moved to a new city. Appearently he didn't know many people, was kinda shy, and the few opportunities he had fell through. And it was at this point he figured that he would probably never participate in his favorite hobby again.
                    <br><br>
                    This made me think about all the other potential fun, memories, and friends lost to the ether just because there was no good way to find people and games.
                    <br><br>
                    Well, don't worry random internet guy, I got your back. I put together this website for the simple purpose of helping people out. Veterens, newcomers, whatever.
                    <br><br>
                    The site is free to use, free of ads (I hate ads!), and I don't sell your data or anything shady like that. And it should hopefully stay that way forever. (I REALLY hate Ads!!!)
                    <br><br>
                    Site was cobbled together myself from html, javascript, and php.
