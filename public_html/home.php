            <br>
            All the base features have now been implemented, making the site ready for a Beta release. (Yay!)<br>
			As this is a Beta release their might be some bugs floating around in the code. If you find any, please let me know at: <b>RPGFriendFinder@gmail.com</b><br>
			Right now Location Search is only set for US zipcodes. Will be adding more countries in time. Let me know if you want your country added.<br>
			Also if there are any features you'd like to see (search fields, profile/game stuff, etc.), suggest them via email, and I will look into it.<br>
			Will be trying to get the word out soon hopefully. If you're reading this and want to help, please tell your friends. Thanks!

                    I was lurking on some RPG Forum and read a story about a guy who had moved to a new city. Appearently he didn't know many people, was kinda shy, and the few opportunities he had fell through. And it was at this point he figured that he would probably never participate in his favorite hobby again.
                    <br><br>
                    This made me think about all the other potential fun, memories, and friends lost to the ether just because there was no good way to find people and games.
                    <br><br>
                    Well, don't worry random internet guy, I got your back. I put together this website for the simple purpose of helping people out. Veterens, newcomers, whatever.
                    <br><br>
                    The site is free to use, free of ads (I hate ads!), and I don't sell your data or anything shady like that. And it should hopefully stay that way forever. (I REALLY hate Ads!!!)
                    <br><br>
                    Site was cobbled together myself from html, javascript, and php.
